_______________
This project activity involves treating and reusing wastewater. It doesn’t include any land-use practices.
Also, this is an industrial process designed with technical requirements and following the specified
norms of the local pollution control board. Hence, the project activity does not harm any land and
Drainage system. 

The impact assessment or objectives of this project activity can generally be enumerated as follows:
 The project activity highlights the catalytic role that corporate India must play in reducing
industrial water consumption as well as water pollution per unit of industrial output.
 The PP has showcased technology that creates safe industrial grade water from an effluent
source and has overcome the challenges faced by the alternate methods implemented and/or
being proposed for the same.

 The PP has showcased the successful wastewater treatment of industrial effluent, thus saving
millions of liters of wastewater to produce Cloths.

 The project activity showcases best-in-class wastewater treatment technology(ZLD) that can
replace the equivalent freshwater and industrial demand in different sectors for nonportable
purposes while reducing the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing
recycling and safe reuse in India.
